Technical Knowledge
--------------------

**Hackathon "Hack 4 Smart Cycling"**

: ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtJhic6XcAABcx3?format=jpg&name=large)

: Took first place in
a [Hackathon](https://www.wuppertaler-rundschau.de/lokales/wuppertaler-studenten-entwickeln-smarte-radfahr-app_aid-56100393)
, where I developed a prototype for a smart cycling system with my team
member [Leon Staubach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leon-staubach-2676a5186/).
: _Idea_: Use Machine Learning and available data to create round trip routes for cyclists, based on
POI categories that they are interested in. We use DBSCAN to create clusters of similar POIs, build routes between
them and reduce the length of each round trip route to the maximum length that a user had set.

**Programming Languages**

:   **Python:** I would consider myself an experienced Python Developer. I have worked with Python3 on multiple
projects, work and
[personal](https://github.com/ViktorWelbers/image-microservice), in the last 5 years. As a professional this includes
working as a Python Backend Engineer at **COCUS AG** and as a working student/master's degree candidate at **Aptiv**. I
have also used Python for research projects as a research assistant
at **BUW**. Apart from typical frameworks for web-dev like FastAPI or Django this also included the use of data
oriented libraries like PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas or NumPy.

:   **Go:** I have a high interest in Go and have mainly used it for personal projects. Here I focused on
building [microservices](https://github.com/ViktorWelbers/geo-feature-service). The reason for learning Go was that I
thought of it as a good complement to Python, since it is more performant, offers great concurrency support and is
statically typed.

:   **JavaScript:** I have used Java-/TypeScript with Angular
or [Vue.js](https://github.com/ViktorWelbers/geo-feature-service-frontend)
to create frontends in several projects. This includes my personal websites, when working as a research assistant
at **BUW** and as a working student at **Aptiv**.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **C++**, **Java** and **Bash**.

**Frameworks and Tools**

: Other tools that I am using / have used on a regular basis:

    * Docker
    * AWS [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), AWS [ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/),
      AWS [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), AWS [DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/),
      AWS [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), AWS [API-GW](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), etc.
    * [Serverless](https://serverless.com/)
    * [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescaledb.com/)
    * [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
    * [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/)
    * Elasticsearch
    * PostgreSQL
    * MongoDB
    * Linux
